In this project, we have created a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images.
I have used COCO Dataset to train and test the image captioning of the images.

The neural network architecture uses CNN as Encoder and LSTM as Decoder with 2 Layers. I have used Batch Normalization,
Dropout regularization, Weight Intialization using xavier_normal distribution to reduce the losses and for good convergence.
